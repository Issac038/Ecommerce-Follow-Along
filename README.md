### Milestone 1: Project Overview

1. Authentication: login logout signup
2. Product page: Displays all the products
3. Orders page: Shows orders for each user
4. Payment gateway


### Milestone 2: Backend and Frontend
1. I created a folder called frontend within which we first created a react file and also installed dependencies and connected the tailwindcss using postCSS. On this folder I created two more folders:
    1. Authorization
    2. Signup

    The Authorization folder contains two more folders which are Login and Signup. As part of milestone 2 I was asked to complete the login page which I have completed.

2. I created a folder called backend which just contains the node modules and I installed express, mongoose, nodemon and cors. 4


### Milestone 3: Server and Database

1. Today I set up a database and a server by using Express and Mongodb-Atlas. I also configured the server to listen on a designated port.
2. I also created a error handling folder for better debugging.


### Milestone 4:

1. I created a User Model: This is like a blueprint for how your users' data will be stored in the database
2. I created a User Controlleras well: This will help you manage what happens with your user data (like adding a new user or getting their information).
3. I also enabled and configured Multer: Multer will allows my app to accept and store files (such as images) uploaded by users.
